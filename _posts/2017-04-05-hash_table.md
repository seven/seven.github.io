# hashing function
  * collision resistance
      * attach SHA1/MD5
        less than 2^(N/2), N bits of hash output.
    
  * uniform distribution

# collision resolution
  * chaining with list/RBT/...
    - linkedlist vs RBT
  * open address
    (hash(key)+ di) mod m, ith times to collision
    * how to avoid **cluster**?
  
# hash open address application in java api 
  * ThreadLocalMap
 ```java

        private Entry getEntry(ThreadLocal<?> key) {
            int i = key.threadLocalHashCode & (table.length - 1);
            Entry e = table[i];
            if (e != null && e.get() == key)
                return e;
            else
                return getEntryAfterMiss(key, i, e); //
        }

```

    * LinkedHashMap
      - double-linked list
      - access order by move access node to last
      - default by insert order
    * Hashtable
      - chaining with single linked list
      - indexing
          - hashtable: int index = (hash & 0x7FFFFFFF) % tab.length;
          - hashmap:   int index = (hash ^ (hash>>>16)) % (tab.length-1);

# Distributed HashTable
  * DHT need to handle:
    * autonomy and decentralization
    * fault tolerance
    * scalability
    * load balance
    * data integrity
    * performance (routing/storage/retrieval)
  * Keyspace partitioning
    Task: removal or addition of one node changes only the set of keys owned by the nodes with adjacent IDs, and leaves all other nodes unaffected. 
    * Consistent hashing
      hashing ring + tags
    * Rendezvous hashing
      client side: highest random weight hashing, selected = max((h(s,key) for s in serverlist)
    * Locality-preserving hashing
      efficient range query by ensure that similar keys are assigned to similar objects. 

# Bloomfilter
  * used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
  * False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not 
  * â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". 
  * Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a "counting" removed_filter, but add removed items back is not supported.); 
  * the more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.

```java
    public boolean add(T object) {
        byte[] state = encode(object);

        int hashIterations = this.hashIterations;
        long size = this.size;
        long[] indexes = hash(state, hashIterations, size);
        ...set bits...
    }

    private long[] hash(byte[] state, int iterations, long size) {
        long hash1 = LongHashFunction.xx_r39().hashBytes(state);
        long hash2 = LongHashFunction.farmUo().hashBytes(state);

        long[] indexes = new long[iterations];
        long hash = hash1;
        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            indexes[i] = (hash & Long.MAX_VALUE) % size;
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                hash += hash2;
            } else {
                hash += hash1;
            }
        }
        return indexes;
    }
